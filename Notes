Basic Overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a series of elements or tags. Each tag has a specific purpose and defines a different part of the web content.

Key Features:

Elements and Tags: HTML documents are made up of elements, which are defined by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <html>, <head>, <body>, <div>, <p>, <a>, etc.
Attributes: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element, e.g., <a href="https://example.com">Link</a>.
Structure: HTML structures the content with elements like headings (<h1> to <h6>), paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul>, <ol>), links (<a>), images (<img>), and more.
Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>, which give more meaning to the document structure.
Example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text on my website.</p>
  <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is the language used to describe the presentation of an HTML document. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a webpage.

Key Features:

Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements for styling. Common selectors include type selectors (p), class selectors (.class-name), ID selectors (#id-name), and more.
Properties and Values: CSS consists of properties and values. Properties are aspects of the element to style, and values define how to style it, e.g., color: blue;, font-size: 16px;, margin: 10px;.
Cascading: The term "cascading" refers to the way CSS applies rules. Styles can be applied from different sources, including inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets, and the cascade determines which styles take precedence.
Responsive Design: CSS enables responsive web design through media queries, allowing the layout to adjust based on the screen size and device.
Example:

css
Copy code
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin: 20px;
}
JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic behavior and interactivity on web pages. It allows developers to create content updates, control multimedia, animate images, and handle user interactions.

Key Features:

Variables and Data Types: JavaScript supports various data types including numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. Variables can be declared using var, let, or const.
Functions: Functions are blocks of code designed to perform particular tasks. They can be defined using function declarations or expressions.
DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing it to dynamically change the content and structure of the web page.
Event Handling: JavaScript can handle events such as clicks, key presses, and form submissions, enabling interactive user experiences.
Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await, allowing for non-blocking operations such as fetching data from a server.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
// Function to display a welcome message
function showWelcomeMessage() {
  alert("Welcome to my website!");
}

// Call the function when the page loads
window.onload = showWelcomeMessage;

// Change the content of a paragraph when a button is clicked
function changeContent() {
  document.getElementById('myParagraph').innerText = "Content has been changed!";
}

document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', changeContent);
Summary
HTML: Structures the content on the web.
CSS: Styles and visually presents the HTML content.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.
Together, these technologies form the foundation of modern web development, allowing developers to create rich, interactive, and visually appealing websites.
